# Join a Friend

CLUB ACCESS REQUIRED TO JOIN

Allows you to copy the link to the server you're in, as well as join another server by pasting the same kind of link. Ideally you would share this link privately over Discord or something similar.

If you try to join someone in a cup division you didn't qualify for, the join will fail. The same is likely true for matchmaking and royal games (though this isn't yet tested).
